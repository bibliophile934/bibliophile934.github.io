# About Me

## Hello World
My name is Ruju! I'm currently a Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo where I am also minoring in Cognitive Science.
I was always intrigued by hacking and cybersecurity but only recently realized it's a very viable career path for me, so here I am! 
I'm now an avid CTF competitor but also love reading, singing, playing video games, and painting in my spare time. 

## Experience
I've done 6 internships in various roles throughout my undergrad degree. 
This includes roles in quality assurance, backend and frontend software engineering, a bit of business, SWE and product management all at once, and cybersecurity.
I've worked at every companies of various sizes including start-ups with 10 full-time employees to large organizations like Hewlett-Packard and the Royal Bank of Canada.

## What I'm Looking For
I'm looking for full-time new-grad roles starting in May of 2021! Ideally, I want to still be able to code while learning as much as I can about cybersecurity, penetration testing, and ethical hacking.
In the future, I want to be able to work in a penetration testing or ethical hacking role. My ideal company will have resources and mentorship for me to grow as a cybersecurity and software professional while also having a great team culture where I can have fun with my co-workers while getting work done!
